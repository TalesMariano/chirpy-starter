It works both on Editor and Play Mode.Example:using UnityEngine;public class ContextTesting : MonoBehaviour{ /// Add a context menu named &quot;Do Something&quot; in the inspector /// of the attached script. [ContextMenu(&quot;Do Something&quot;)] void DoSomething() { Debug.Log(&quot;Perform operation&quot;); }}I really like to use it to both automate setups in the scene and test function in play mode, without the hassle to add “Input.OnKeyDown(…){DoTheThing()}”. Also it’s pretty safe to leave it on the code, since it doesn’t affect the final compiled game. Also, it’s pretty fast to implement, the other alternative being creating a custom Editor script and adding an Editor button.This is my tip of the day.Till Next Time!" }, { "title": "Making this blog", "url": "/blog/posts/Making-this-blog/", "categories": "Tech, Blog", "tags": "blog, jekyll", "date": "2022-03-08 00:00:00 -0300", "snippet": "Making this blogI’ve been reading Austin Kloen’s Show your Work book, which made me more inclined to share my work. Also it talk about besides sharing on social media, having your own blog.JekyllSo I started looking for options for creating my blog. Since my new portifolio is now on Github using github pages, I started looking for personal blogs hosted on github, and found a video about Jekyll Now - Create a Free Blog in GitHub Using JekyllI tried it, but found the page design not quite yey what I wanted. Looking more into Jekyll, I found more layout themes, including Chipy theme, which I quite liked, and matched what I wanted on my blog.After some experiemnts using Jekyll, Jekyll Now and the Chirpy Theme, I followed the tutorial on Chirpy Documentation, and soon enought my blog was Online. I also had help from this youtube video: - Como criar um blog no GitHub Pages com Jekyll (pt-br)Now the next step it to start posting often, and improving any lacking feature I find of the the blog site.Till next Time!" }, { "title": "Hello World", "url": "/blog/posts/hello-world/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-03-03 00:00:00 -0300", "snippet": "Hello WorldThis is the first post of the blog.I’m still learning how all this blog stuff works.My next step are finishing all session on the blog page, and how to add tags and I guess “folders”.Till Next Time!" } ]
