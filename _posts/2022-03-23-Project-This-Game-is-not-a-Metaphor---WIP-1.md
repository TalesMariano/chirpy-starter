I'm making a new short game project, current named Project This Game is not a Metaphor.

It is based on Brian David Gilbert's Video "This song is not a metaphor" - [this song is not a metaphor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfw9n2ktX9k)

The game is going to be a Snake like game with a world bending Shader.

I already made some tests with bases on this video: [Animal Crossing World Bending Effect | Shader Graph | Unity Tutorial
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOK3Ias5Nk0)

Today I worked on creating on looping the world, to create an infinite effect: [Project This Game is not a Metaphour - WIP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBRqYFQqdfU)

The next steps are creating the player movement to be more like a snake game, and integrating the world bending shader effect on the game.

Till next Time!
